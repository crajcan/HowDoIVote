# Front End for HowDoIVote/WhereDoIVote
Open source, robust web app for helping people register to vote and find polling locations.  
  
Backend: https://github.com/crajcan/voting_data_api

## Motivation:
Figuring out how to vote, how to register, and where to vote is far too difficult. Government websites have awful UI/UX, are unmaintained and out of date. Valiant attempts have been made by non-profits to make voting easier via the internet, however these projects also appear to be lacking vital information and have the major pitfall of not being open source. It's not obvious that you can contribute unless you work for them, and they probably can't afford to hire you. Figuring out how to vote can be a significant challenge even for tech-competent, native english speakers.

## Vision:

Leverage recent tech and the open source community to develop voter info websites that are as simple, robust, dynamic, and knowledgeable as possible. Provide a rich UI/UX with only the data immediately needed by the user. Exploit whatever APIs possible, but offer redirects if possible if support goes down. Crowdsource instructions and location information. Be multilingual and accessible. Think Wikipedia or Stack Overflow, only for voting.
